    description: "How many kilograms of fresh larvae can be produced from 50 grams of eggs \n\n Estimation: \n\n 👉 50 grams of BSF eggs can produce approximately 160 to 400 kilograms of fresh larvae if incubated and raised under optimal conditions. \n\n 🐛 CALCIUM WORM EGGS\n 🔹 Calcium worm eggs are the initial stage of calcium worms, laid by the Black Soldier Fly (BSF). Once hatched, the eggs develop into larvae, which are nutrient-rich and commonly used as feed for various animals. \n\n 1. Preparation of Materials and Equipment\n BSF eggs: Collected from the egg-laying trays of mature black soldier flies. \n\n Egg incubation substrate: Materials that decompose easily and retain moisture, such as:\n • Rice bran / Corn bran\n • Soybean pulp\n • Oilseed cake\n • Finely chopped vegetable and fruit scraps \n\n Incubation container: Plastic box with a lid, foam tray, or plastic tub (size depends on the amount of eggs). \n\n Tissue paper / coffee filter paper (optional, if wrapping eggs). \n\n Mosquito net or fine mesh (to prevent ants and other insects). \n\n 2. Egg Incubation Process\n Preparing the incubation environment: \n\n Step 1:\n Place the incubation tray in a spot with mild lighting, avoiding direct sunlight.\n Ensure good ventilation to prevent condensation and mold growth. \n\n Step 2: Add the eggs:\n Spread the BSF eggs evenly on top of chick feed in the incubation tray, making sure they are not overly compressed. \n\n Step 3: Mist with water:\n Spray a light mist of water onto the chick feed surface to maintain humidity, but avoid soaking it. \n\n Monitoring and maintenance:\n Check temperature and humidity daily.\n Use a fan if needed to improve airflow and control humidity. \n\n Hatching stage:\n After about 24–48 hours, the eggs will hatch into larvae.\n The larvae will feed and grow in the chick feed.\n Ensure adequate food is provided throughout the growth period (approximately 10–14 days). \n\n Step 4: Check and maintain moisture:\n • Check daily and keep the substrate moist, but not overly wet.\n • After 2–4 days, eggs will hatch into small white larvae. \n\n 3. Transition to Growing Stage\n Once the eggs have fully hatched, transfer the entire substrate to the growing tray, or sift the larvae into a new tray with the main feed. \n\n The used incubation substrate can also serve as bedding in the growing tray.",
